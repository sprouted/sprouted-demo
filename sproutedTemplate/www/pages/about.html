    <div class="block block-strong">
      <p>This app was developed by the Coding Club (collaborators including: Tahmidul Alam, Sumit Das, William Doyle, Danielle Simon, Ellie Tien, and Mehdad Zaman) and with the guidance, help, and support of our wonderful advisor Ms. Tanzosh! </p>
      <p>The goal of this app is to consolidate all important Nest+m events into one central location. If you happen to miss morning anouncments, you'll be able to easily view any upcoming Nest+m events on our app!</p>
      <p>Keep track of club events, sports games, schoolwide events, and school holidays by viewing the main page.</p>
      <p>We would love to get any feedback on the app so please email dragondcs28@gmail.com or ellielicious00@gmail.com. We hope you enjoy the app!</p>
